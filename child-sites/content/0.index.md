# Hi I'm Ricardo
## Welcome to my blog

I am passionate about learning and growing, and writing is a powerful
way to process and reflect on the world around us. I have lived abroad for over three
decades, which has been a life-changing experience. It has pushed me out of my comfort
zone, helped me to become more open-minded, and taught me so much about myself and the
world around me. I hope that sharing my experiences will inspire you to explore your
untapped potential and propel you to evolve into the best version of yourself.

## About me
I'm working on it.
